    A Sandbox Website

        The primary idea of this website is to just be a sandbox for my ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have written some code in my freetime in Python and C++, but sadly it's difficult to show some of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought a website is the perfect way to showcase some of my stuff but to also learn some new skills!
      </p>
      <p>
        So I decided to learn Angular as the Frontend Framework and later implement my code on a Flask backend server for Python code - mainly for the Neural Networks -
        as well as a NodeJs server for JavaScript related stuff.
      </p>

      <p>At the moment I have written some simple algorithms like the <a routerLink="/PP/Conway">Game of life</a>, a <a routerLink="/PP/Fractal">Fractal Tree Generator</a> and the
        <a routerLink="/PP/AStar"> A* Pathfinding algorithm</a>,
        give it a try, but please try not to break it, it might break your current tab in the browser if you try hard enough!</p>

      <p>
        You can also take a look at my Repo with the link in the top right hand corner,
        the code for Angular is probably abysmal, but not as bad as the algorithms,
        they are extremely inefficient, but they work, so hey, don't fix what's not broken.<br>
        Im probably gonna look into it later, but for now, it suffices.

    <ul class="vertical"> <h3>TODO</h3>
      <li [ngStyle]="{'width' : WSM.DesktopMode? '50%' : '100%'}" *ngFor="let item of TODO">{{item}}</li>
      <br>
      ...and much more!
    </ul>
